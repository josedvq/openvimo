# Tutorial Intro

In this tutorial we will go over setting up OpenVIMO locally for a videocalling experiment. This setup can be used to test the platform in a local PC or local network and implement new features before deploying to a production server.

The tutorial will not directly cover deployment to an online server as the requirements for this setup will depend largely on the network infrastructure of your department. Links will be provided to the appropriate documentation for setting up OpenVIMO in a production server.
